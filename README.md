## Technical skills
### I'm an adaptive and collaborative Front-end Developer, kick-starting my journey with React and Next.js projects at 'FrontendCafe', where I learned to navigate team dynamics and the intricacies of project management.
### My technical acumen in responsive design and client-focused development was matched by a strong commitment to clear communication, *problem-solving*, and proactive learning, especially in mapping technologies and *UI frameworks*. 
### Currently, I'm leveraging my strong analytical skills and creative thinking to explore the frontiers of *AI*, eager to contribute to and grow with a forward-thinking team.
